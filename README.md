Playing with GitHub

This is part of the Github tutorial.

In this tutorial, we are learning about the following concepts/steps:
* Repository
* Banches
  * Master
  * Feature : created from the Master branch
* Commit changes
  * Commmiting changes to content on a specific branch
* Open pull requests
  * Show changes and engage discussions
    * Green = added content
    * Red = deleted content
  * It is ok to pull a request before the code is finished
* Merge a pull request
  * Once the merge is confirmed, the "feature" branch can be deleted
